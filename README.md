# Hi everyone üëã
## About me
- üòä I'm **Guto Leoni Santos**, a data scientist and researcher currently working with Generative AI at AWS Generative AI Innovation Center. Part of my job is to plan solution for different costumers that wants to use generative AI to impulse their business.
- üåç Over the past **six years**, I've been building AI-driven solutions with applications in **economics, health, business**, and computing, often collaborating with governments and private enterprises to deliver impactful projects.

<!--
I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the Universidade of Pernambuco, a Master's degree and a PhD in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. In my undergraduate work, I worked with performance evaluation of virtualization technologies, comparing different virtualizers for the allocation of a 3D reconstruction application. In my master's degree, I developed mathematical models to evaluate the performance of IoT applications for healthcare systems. Finally, in my PhD, I developed a framework based on reinforcement learning algorithms for allocating service function chains in large distributed networks.
In parallel to my research, I worked on several research projects that focus on software development. I worked with web systems development with Angular and type script for the frontend, as well as rest APIs in Java and Python for the backend.
