# Hi everyone üëã
## About me
- üòÄ My name is Guto Leoni Santos, I am a postdoctoral researcher working on the use of Large Language Models in text classification in a business context at Dublin City University. 
- üî≠ I have six years of experience developing solutions based on artificial intelligence with applications in the most diverse fields of knowledge: economics, health, business, and computing. Additionally, I participate in research projects in partnership with governments and private companies.

<!--
I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems from the Universidade of Pernambuco, a Master's degree and a PhD in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. In my undergraduate work, I worked with performance evaluation of virtualization technologies, comparing different virtualizers for the allocation of a 3D reconstruction application. In my master's degree, I developed mathematical models to evaluate the performance of IoT applications for healthcare systems. Finally, in my PhD, I developed a framework based on reinforcement learning algorithms for allocating service function chains in large distributed networks.
In parallel to my research, I worked on several research projects that focus on software development. I worked with web systems development with Angular and type script for the frontend, as well as rest APIs in Java and Python for the backend.
